ResearchQ turns months of manual paper screening into days of structured, reproducible, AI-assisted research. It combines the [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) academic graph (250M+ papers) with Google Gemini to automate the tedious parts of a systematic literature review — discovery, screening, metadata extraction, and synthesis — while keeping the researcher in full control of every decision.

Every search is logged. Every inclusion decision is recorded. Every AI extraction is traceable. The tool is built around 18 peer-reviewed review methodologies (PRISMA, Cochrane, Kitchenham, JBI, GRADE, and others) and exports everything in the formats journals actually require: BibTeX, CSV, DOCX, Markdown, JSON.

It runs entirely on your own machine (SQLite + Node.js) or, if you prefer, on your own Postgres. No SaaS, no vendor lock-in, your data never leaves your disk.

## Project status

ResearchQ is **alpha**. The core workflow (project setup → search → screening → extraction → review output) is feature-complete, but the tool has not yet undergone peer review and the API surface may change between minor versions until `1.0.0`. A JOSS submission is in preparation.

## Screenshots

### Dashboard

![Dashboard](docs/assets/dashboard.png)

The project dashboard — at-a-glance stats for papers, relevant items, search jobs, and recent activity across the active project. The sidebar project selector lets you jump between isolated research projects; each has its own papers, keywords, and analysis framework.

### Powerful, multi-strategy article search

![Search strategies](docs/assets/powerful-article-search.png)

Six search strategies over the [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) graph — topic, journal, author, publisher-scoped database search, and forward/backward citation chains. Every run shows a live progress feed (fetching → storing → AI screening → metadata extraction), and database searches are cursor-resumable so long runs survive interruptions.

### Cross-reference matrix

![Cross-reference matrix](docs/assets/cross-ref.png)

The heart of any systematic review: every relevant paper side-by-side with title, year, authors, venue, methodology, region, platform, and population. Sort any column, filter by year range or full text, and export the whole table as CSV, BibTeX, or JSON.

### Research intelligence

![Research intelligence](docs/assets/research-intelligence.png)

Beyond simple aggregation — prolific authors with their keyword specialties, co-authorship networks, year-over-year keyword trends, AI-generated gap analysis identifying under-researched areas, and duplicate detection for papers collected from different searches.

### Guided literature review execution

![Literature review phase stepper](docs/assets/literature-review.png)

Apply any of the 18 built-in methodologies (PRISMA shown here — or Cochrane, Kitchenham, Arksey & O'Malley, JBI, GRADE, ENTREQ, and more). Each phase has a visible status, a note field, and one-click generation of the expected outputs: PRISMA flow diagrams, data extraction matrices, GRADE evidence tables, narrative syntheses, and 16 other deliverables — all traceable back to your paper data.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/ErenDexter/ResearchQ.git
cd ResearchQ
pnpm install

# 2. Configure (at minimum: set an LLM API key)
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env — see Configuration below

# 3. Create the local SQLite database
pnpm db:push

# 4. Run the dev server
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 — you'll be redirected straight to the "Create your first project" form. Describe your research domain in plain language, and the AI will generate keywords, analysis dimensions, and relevance criteria in about 30 seconds.

See [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) for a step-by-step walkthrough from install to first exported cross-reference matrix.

## Deployment

### **Deploy to Diploi**

[![launch with diploi button](https://diploi.com/launch-big.svg)](https://diploi.com/launch/ErenDexter/ResearchQ)

1. **Launch the project**

Click the launch button above to create a new Diploi deployment.

2. **Add environment variables**

In Diploi, open your deployment page and go to **Options > SvelteKit > Environment**. Add any required environment variables that are missing.

3. **Run the database migration**

Click **Connect +** in the SvelteKit section, then run the copied SSH command in your local terminal.

In the `/app` directory, run:

```bash
pnpm run db:push
```

After that, accept the db queries to be applied interactively in the terminal by selecting "Yes, I want to execute all statements".

4. **Preview the deployment**

Open the provided preview URL from your Diploi deployment page.

## Installation

### Requirements

- **Node.js** ≥ 20
- **pnpm** ≥ 9 (or use `npm` / `yarn` with equivalent commands)
- A **build toolchain** for `better-sqlite3` native bindings:
  - macOS: Xcode command-line tools (`xcode-select --install`)
  - Linux: `build-essential` and `python3`
  - Windows: [windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) or Visual Studio Build Tools
- An **LLM API key** — one of:
  - [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/ai-gateway) (default, has a free tier)
  - [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) (direct Gemini access)

Detailed install guide and troubleshooting: [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md).

### Using Postgres instead of SQLite

SQLite is the default and works out of the box for local use. If you want to deploy ResearchQ as a shared service, set `DB_DIALECT=postgres` and point `DATABASE_URL` at your Postgres instance. Then run `pnpm db:push:pg` to apply the schema. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for details.

---

## Configuration

All configuration lives in `.env`. The authoritative reference is [.env.example](.env.example) — copy it to `.env` and fill in the blanks. Summary:

| Variable | Purpose | Default | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DB_DIALECT` | `sqlite` (local) or `postgres` (cloud) | `sqlite` | No |
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLite file path **or** Postgres connection string | `./data/researchq.db` | No |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `gateway` (Vercel AI Gateway) or `google` (Google AI Studio direct) | `gateway` | No |
| `LLM` | Gemini model ID (e.g. `google/gemini-2.0-flash` or `gemini-2.5-flash`) | `google/gemini-2.0-flash` | No |
| `AI_GATEWAY_KEY` | Vercel AI Gateway key | — | Yes (gateway mode) |
| `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` | Google AI Studio key | — | Yes (google mode) |
| `OPENALEX_EMAIL` | Your email — gets you into OpenAlex's faster "polite" pool | — | Recommended |

## Architecture

ResearchQ is a SvelteKit app with a clean server-side module boundary. The browser is a thin client — all AI calls, database access, and OpenAlex requests happen server-side.

## Acknowledgments

ResearchQ is built on the shoulders of:

- [**OpenAlex**](https://openalex.org/) — the open academic graph that makes multi-source discovery possible.
- [**Google Gemini**](https://ai.google.dev/) — the LLM behind relevance screening, extraction, and synthesis.
- [**Vercel AI Gateway**](https://vercel.com/ai-gateway) — lowers the barrier to getting a working LLM key.
- [**SvelteKit**](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [**Drizzle ORM**](https://orm.drizzle.team/), [**better-sqlite3**](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3), [**bits-ui**](https://bits-ui.com/), [**Lucide**](https://lucide.dev/).

### AI usage disclosure

Generative AI is a core runtime feature of ResearchQ (relevance screening, metadata extraction, synthesis output generation) and is disclosed in the [paper.md](paper.md) AI usage section per JOSS 2026 guidelines. All AI-generated outputs are traceable to the prompts in [src/lib/server/prompts.ts](src/lib/server/prompts.ts) and are always reviewable and overridable by the user.
